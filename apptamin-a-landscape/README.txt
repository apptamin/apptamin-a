Note: In order to install this Apptamin Theme, 
you have to download the Thematic Theme 
(the Apptamin A theme is a Thematic Child Theme 
and inherits all of the functionalities), 
upload both themes to your server in the themes folder 
and then activate the Apptamin Theme.

To download the Thematic Theme : http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/thematic

Use the Apptamin theme files to create and modify your Apptamin theme. 
This folder has to be moved to wp-content/themes, along side the
Thematic folder.
Activate your new theme just like any other WordPress theme.

FAQ
********************************************************
Q: I installed the theme but it's not working. Why?
A: Please verify that you also installed the Thematic Theme, as
the Apptamin A Theme is a Thematic Child Theme (see above).

Q: I installed the theme and it kinda works but many things don't display. Why?
A: I don't know why. But it seems that you have to go to the Appearance -> Widgets 
in the admin section before the theme displays correctly.


Q: I know CSS and would like to create my own awesome design. How do I do that?
A: You can either create your own yourstyles.css file (and modify styles.css so it uses it)
or modify one of the 2 examples we provided (yourstyles-example1.css or yourstyles-example2.css)

Q: How can I change the favicon (the icon in the browser title bar)?
A: Create your own image, favicon.png for example, rename it favicon.ico and replace the one 
that is currently in the images/ folder.

Q: How to create multiple pages for showcasing my apps?
A: I don't know, and that's one of the reason the project is on GitHub:
so people better at coding than me can improve the theme.
So far, the best workaround is to use the multi-site property of Wordpress
to create a website per app, then using subdomains that link one to another.
