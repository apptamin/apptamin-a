Note: In order to install this Apptamin Theme, 
you have to download the Thematic Theme 
(the Apptamin A theme is a Thematic Child Theme 
and inherits all of the functionalities), 
upload both themes to your server in the themes folder 
and then activate the Apptamin Theme.

To download the Thematic Theme : http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/thematic


Use the Apptamin theme files to create and modify your Apptamin theme. 
This folder has to be moved to wp-content/themes, along side the
Thematic folder.
Activate your new theme just like any other WordPress theme.

Good luck!
